By "functional", we mean they do so in a way that provides the flexibility and composability we came to expect from functions. We will study functional references as implemented by the powerful lens library. lens is named after lenses, a particularly well known kind of functional reference. Beyond being very interesting from a conceptual point of view, lenses and other functional references allow for several convenient and increasingly common idioms, put into use by a number of useful libraries.', 'https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Lenses_and_functional_references', 'Book', '2018-06-19')
